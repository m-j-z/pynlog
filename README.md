# pynlog
pynlog is a lightweight logging library for Python that focuses on clarity and extensibility.
Out of the box, it prints color-coded logs to the console and writes the same log to a file with automatic rollover at 50MB.
pynlog gives a simple, modern alternative to Python's built-in logging.
